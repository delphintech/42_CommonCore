## Developed skills
 - **Algorithms & AI**: Standards algorithms on standards structures: searching, sorting, insertion, deletion, balance. State machine and asynchronous management.

 - **Graphics**: Image management, RGB structure of an image, manipulating areas, drawing into an image, interacting with the window management system and getting user events and inputs from keyboard and mouse, programming with callbacks and event loop.

 - **Group & interpersonal**: Collaboration, relationships and group management situations, including different kinds of interactions between people (friendly, tensions ...)

 - **Imperative programming**:  C programming : the C syntax, variable, loops, conditional ranches, functions, recursivity, instructions, calculus and expressions, comparisons operators, standard and advanced types, strings processing, structures, includes and libraries, memory allocation and release, linked lists, trees, the C standard library
 
 - **Network & system administration**: Basics of computer networking : IP addresses, subnets, default routing, local network structure, host to host connectivity to network services; Basics of system administration : operating system installation with Linux, setting up security, access, users, storage, installing network services like mail, dns, web server, ...
 
 - **Object-oriented programming**: Object programming principles in C++, classes, namespaces, constructors and destructors,
memory management in C++, inheritance, abstraction, overloading, templates, standard C++ library types and tools

 - **Rigor**: The need to fulfill administrative and technical constraints. The need for a wide and deep testing process to eliminate failure.

 - **System programming**: Classic Unix system interactions : system calls, Blesystem access and management, process creation,
execution, management; inter-process communications : pipes and signals; device management and ioctl, terminal capabilities;
network communication : TCP & UDP sockets, DNS resolution, endianness

- **Web**: The client-server architecture involved in the web, role and actions of the web server, role and actions of the web browser; The
HTTP protocol; Web technologies involved : HTML, CSS, Javascript, images and videos; Backend language and framework for
dynamic websites: Node, Typescript ; MVC model; users web services : web sessions, authentication, cookies, search, caddie, back office configuration, ... ; Basics of user experience, user interface, and
